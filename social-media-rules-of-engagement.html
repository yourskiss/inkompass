                We have created our INKOMPASS social media sites to foster conversations around who we are, what we do, and what it is like to work here. They have not been created to market, advertise or promote our products, consumer brands or securities. These rules of engagement (“Rules”) are intended to ensure that meaningful, constructive, and transparent discussions take place on our social media sites. We are currently present on Facebook, YouTube, LinkedIn, and Instagram. By using any of our INKOMPASS social media sites, you agree to comply with these Rules.
