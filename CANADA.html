                        <p>If you are not satisfied with your answer, you have the option to re-record it. If you choose that option, remember your second recording will be final and you will have to submit it.</p>

                            "The on-ground assessment is the final step in the INKOMPASS selection process. It is a one-day event where candidates can showcase their skills in business cases and team activities, network with other applicants, and meet current RBH employees. This occurs in a fun and cool setting so that you feel at ease and can deliver your best.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            While this is an on-ground event, currently it takes place virtually as most markets are still working from home. The Virtual on-ground assessment or VOGA is as fun and engaging and gives the candidates the same opportunities to showcase their skills. "
