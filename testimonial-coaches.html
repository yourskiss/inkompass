        <h2>
            How has been your experience of working in PMI since 2015?
        </h2>
        <p>
            I would describe my experience at PMI as simply amazing. The organization has offered unique opportunities which have helped me grow professionally. It also offered me an interesting chance to work on real business problems and learn through that experience. The challenges have transformed me and added value to my knowledge.
        </p>
        <h2>
            What are your views on PMI’s vision of a smoke-free future?
        </h2>
        <p>
            I believe that like PMI cares about its people, it equally cares about the environment. I am interested in working on our organization’s strong sustainability commitment. Its vision is one of the key reasons I am a part of PMI.
        </p>
        <h2>
            How has PMI contributed to your professional growth from an intern to a mentor?
        </h2>
        <p>
            PMI is an organization that invests in its people. It has offered me training, courses, and opportunities to grow throughout my internship journey and even after that. I understand the tasks involved in mentorship as I have observed and absorbed the qualities of my mentor during my internship. As a mentor, my biggest role is to explain the workings of our organization to the interns which eventually has helped me understand PMI better.
