            <h3>Who are we?</h3>
            <p>
                We are a member of Philip Morris International. Our details (name, address, etc.) would have been given to you separately at the time of (or to confirm) the collection of information about you, for example, in a notice on an app or a website or in an e-mail, containing a link to this notice.

                    PMI: Philip Morris International, a leading international tobacco group. It is made up of a number of companies or “affiliates”. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    PMI affiliates: Each member of the Philip Morris International group of companies is a “PMI affiliate”. “We” (or “us” or “our”) refers to each PMI affiliate: when you set up a candidate profile or apply for a job, you provide information about yourself to each PMI affiliate, and each PMI affiliate may process information about you for its own recruitment purposes. This is the case even when where you respond to a job posting that mentions a particular PMI affiliate or country/territory.

            </ul>
 

            <h3>How do we collect information about you?</h3>
            <p>
                We may collect information about you in various ways: 
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li> You may provide us with information directly (e.g. when creating an account, creating a candidate profile, applying for a job, attending an interview, completing a test/assessment, sending an e-mail, or making a call to us). </li>
                <li>  We may collect information automatically (e.g. when you use a PMI app or website).</li>
                <li>  We may acquire information from third parties (e.g. from recruitment agencies, reference providers, (where permitted by law) background screening providers and publicly-available sources, such as a company website, internet searches or social media platforms such as LinkedIn). </li>
            </ul>
                
            <p>
                In this notice, we refer to all the methods by which you are in contact with us, as “PMI touchpoints”. PMI touchpoints include both physical (for example, offices, retail outlets and events), and digital (for example, apps and websites). 
            </p>
            <p>

                <li> complete online skills and aptitude tests,  </li>
                <li> attend an event that a PMI affiliate has organised (e.g. through sensors at the event that connect with mobile technology),  </li>

            </ul>
            <p>
                We may also collect information about you automatically through the use of cookies and similar tracking technologies on digital PMI touchpoints. The specific cookies and technologies used will depend on the PMI touchpoint in question. To learn about the cookies (including Google analytics cookies) and similar technologies used on a touchpoint, including how you can accept or refuse cookies, please see the cookie notice made available on or through that touchpoint. 
                <br>
                Where permitted by law, we may acquire information about you from third parties. This may include:  
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li> information from recruitment agencies, </li>
                <li> information shared between PMI affiliates, </li>
                <li> information from third party social media sites (for example, if you choose to simplify your login process to the job platform to allow direct access once you have signed in to your third party social media account, like Gmail or Yahoo!, or if you want to upload information to the platform (for example, from LinkedIn) instead of manually completing an application), and </li>
                <li> Publicly-available profile information (such as your experience, skills, and interests) on third party social media sites (such as LinkedIn). We may also collect information in other contexts made apparent to you at the time.</li>

                Where we do not base our use of information about you on one of the above legal bases, or where law requires it, we will ask for your consent before we process the information (these cases will be clear from the context). We may from time to time ask for your explicit consent to process special categories of information about you. In some instances, we may use information about you in ways that are not described above. Where this is the case, we will provide a supplemental privacy notice that explains such use. You should read any supplemental notice in conjunction with this notice.
            </p>
            <h3>Do we make any automated decisions?</h3>
            <p>
                We may make automated decisions on any of the matters set out in this notice (for example, whom to include on a shortlist for interview). If we do this, we will draw this to your attention at the time, together with information about the logic involved in the decision, as well as the significance and the envisaged consequences for you of such use of information about you.
            </p>
            <h3>Who do we share your information with, and for what purposes?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li style="list-style: none;">We may share information about you with:</li>
                <li>PMI affiliates, </li>
                <li>third parties who provide PMI affiliates or you with products or services (such as recruitment agencies, background screening and online assessment providers), and </li>
                <li>other third parties, where required or permitted by law (such as regulatory authorities, government departments, past, potential or future employers, and in the context of organisational restructuring). We share information about you with others only in accordance with applicable laws. Thus, where law requires your consent, we will first ask for it.</li>
            </ul> 

            <h3>Sharing data with other PMI affiliates</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Information about you will be shared with Philip Morris Products S.A. (based in Neuchâtel, Switzerland), which is the place of central administration of personal data processing for PMI affiliates. Information about you may also be shared with Philip Morris International IT Service Centre Sàrl (based in Lausanne, Switzerland) as technology provider for PMI affiliates. Philip Morris Products S.A. and (to the extent it has access) Philip Morris International IT Service Centre Sàrl process the information about you for all the purposes described in this notice.</li>
                <li>Information about you will be shared with other PMI affiliates for all the purposes described in this notice (for example, to determine if you meet the requirements of jobs available at any of the PMI affiliates). When you upload information to the job search platform, it will be made available to each PMI affiliate; each PMI affiliate may process it for its own recruitment purposes. This is the case even where you respond to a job posting that mentions a particular PMI affiliate. Accordingly, information about you may be transferred globally (if your information is collected within the European Economic Area, this means that your information may be transferred outside it).<br>
                Details of PMI affiliates and the countries in which they are established are available here.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Country-specific additional points</h3>
            <p>
                According to which country you are in, we want you to be aware of some further points. 
                <br><br>
                If you are in Japan, <b>find out more…</b>
                <br><br>
                If you are in Japan, note that we share information about you, for the purposes described in this notice, with other PMI affiliates on the basis of “joint use” under Japanese data protection laws. When we do this, Philip Morris Japan Limited (PMJ) continues to manage your personal information responsibly, and we require those with whom we share the data to do the same. Further, if they are located outside Japan, we take reasonable measures in accordance with the relevant laws and regulations.
            </p>
            <h3>Sharing data with third parties</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>To the extent permitted by applicable law, we may share information about you with third parties who provide PMI affiliates or you with products or services (such as recruitment agencies, background screening providers, online assessment providers, information services providers and identity verification providers). </li>
                <li>To the extent permitted by applicable law, we may share information about you with other third parties, where required or permitted by law, for example: regulatory authorities, government departments, in response to a request from law enforcement authorities or other government officials; when we consider disclosure to be necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity; and in the context of organisational restructuring. </li>
                <li>If we arrange travel or accommodation for you (e.g. if you need to travel to attend an interview), information about you may be shared with third parties who arrange travel and accommodation, provide transport or travel-related services, such as travel agents, online booking providers, ticketing agents, airlines, car hire companies, rail providers and hotels. These third parties will use information about you for their own purposes (for example, to discharge their obligations to provide transport or accommodation to you) and you should check their privacy notices for further details about their use of information about you. Note also that you may have rights, exercisable against such third parties, in respect of their processing of information about you.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Where might information about you be sent?</h3>
            <p>
                As with any multinational organisation, PMI affiliates transfer information globally. When you upload information to the job search platform, you provide it to all PMI affiliates, each of which may process it for its own recruitment purposes. This is the case even where you respond to a job posting that mentions a particular PMI affiliate. Accordingly, information about you may be transferred globally (for example, if you are in the European Economic Area (“EEA”), your information may be transferred outside the EEA; if you are in Australia, you information may be transferred outside Australia). 
                <br><br>
                Find out more… 
                <br><br>
                When using information as described in this notice, information about you may be transferred either within or outside the country or territory where it was collected, including to a country or territory that may not have equivalent data protection standards. PMI affiliates within the EEA will transfer personal information to PMI affiliates outside the EEA. For example, to facilitate the operation of a global business. In all cases, the transfer will be: 
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>on the basis of a European Commission adequacy decision,</li>
                <li>subject to appropriate safeguards, for example the EU Model Contracts, or </li>
                <li>necessary to discharge obligations under a contract between you and us (or the implementation of pre-contractual measures taken at your request) or for the conclusion or performance of a contract concluded in your interest between us and a third party, such as in relation to travel arrangements.</li>
            </ul>       
            <p> 
                In all cases, appropriate security measures for the protection of personal information will be applied in those countries or territories, in accordance with applicable data protection laws.
                <br>
                Our service providers are located in many countries throughout the world, including in particular the EEA, Switzerland, the USA, Canada, India, the Philippines, Indonesia, and Australia.
            </p>
            <h3>How do we protect information about you?</h3>
            <p>
                We implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect personal information that we hold from unauthorised disclosure, use, alteration or destruction. Where appropriate, we use encryption and other technologies that can assist in securing the information you provide. We also require our service providers to comply with equivalent data privacy and security requirements. 
            </p>
            <h3>How long will information about you be kept?</h3>
            <p>
                We will retain information about you for the period necessary to fulfil the purposes for which the information was collected. After that, we will delete it. The period will vary depending on the purposes for which the information was collected. Note that in some circumstances, you have the right to request us to delete the information. Also, we are sometimes legally obliged to retain the information, for example, for tax and accounting purposes. 
            </p>
            <p><b>Typically, we retain data based on the criteria described in the table below:</b></p>
            <div class="privacytable">
                <table>
                    <tr>

                                If you apply for a job with us, we will keep a record of your application and retain it while it remains relevant to our relationship, for example during the recruitment process, to tell you about other opportunities that may be of interest and, if your application is successful, during your employment with us.
                                <br>
                                Typically, information about you is kept for up to 12 months after the date on which you last logged into the recruitment platform. As a minimum, we keep records of the recruitment process for the statutory period in which a claim arising from the recruitment process may be brought. We may keep information about you for longer if you apply for certain types of jobs and this is allowed or required in the country where that job is based. 
                                <br>
                                Other records relevant to the recruitment process (for example, assessment results and background checks) are retained for a short period until more permanent records are made (for example, a record of the result of the assessment or background check).

                <li>If you are in France, you have the right to give us instructions regarding information we hold about you in the event of your death (specifically, whether we should store or delete it, and whether others should have the right to see it). You may:</li>
                <li>issue general instructions to a digital service provider registered with the French data protection supervisory authority (called “CNIL”) (these instructions apply to all use of information about you); or</li>
                <li>give us specific instructions that apply only to our use of information about you. Your instructions may require us to transfer information about you to a third party (but where the information contains information about others, our obligation to respect also their privacy rights might mean that we can’t follow your instructions to the letter). You may appoint a third party to be responsible for ensuring your instructions are followed. If you do not appoint a third party in that way, your successors will (unless you specify otherwise in your instructions) be entitled to exercise your rights over information about you after your death: </li>
                <li>in order to administer your estate (in which case your successors will be able to access information about you to identify and obtain information that could be useful to administer your estate, including any digital goods or data that could be considered a family memory that is transferable to your successors); and</li>
                <li>to ensure that parties using information about you take into account your death (such as closing your account, and restricting the use of, or updating, information about you). You may amend or revoke your instructions at any time. For further information on the processing of information about you in the event of your death, see Article 40-1 of the law 78-17 dated 6 January 1978. When you die, by default, you will stop using your account and we will delete information about you in accordance with our retention policies (see the paragraph “How long will information about you be kept?” for details).</li>
