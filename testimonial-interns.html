        <h2>
             What transformation did you go through or observed in yourself after you joined INKOMPASS internship?
        </h2>
        <p>
            As part of my transformation as an INKOMPASS intern, I challenged myself to discover what personal and professional skills I possessed. During the internship, I changed and improved a lot, learnt how to use multicultural communication skills to my advantage and managed to develop my presentation skills. 
            <br><br>
            I also transformed into a person with technical skills. Earlier I used to consider myself only as a commercial and social person, but I have realized that I can acquire and utilize technical skills to achieve certain objectives for the organization.

            According to you, what makes PMI a great place to work?
        </h2>
        <p>
            Philip Morris always fosters and promotes inclusion and diversity. I think that is great as it is important to have different ideas and opinions on any problem to reach a more human solution. Due to this diverse culture, I have acquired a more empathetic sense of teamwork which will help me in the future as well. I believe the more diverse the group, the broader set of opinions you have and if you have team members with different ideologies and different cultural backgrounds, then you’ll have a broader context in which you can use your ideas.

            What are your thoughts on PMI’s new vision of a smoke-free future?
        </h2>
        <p>
            I think PMI’s vision of a smoke-free future is very appealing. I believe new ideologies and the new perceptions of the world are in favour of health, environment, and human rights. If the younger generation comes together to think about smoke related problems in the world, you are going to have real and impactful solutions. I am confident that a smoke-free future can materialize with innovation, transformation, and better alternatives.

            I have always wanted to do something for the society and now I am working to find solutions to make people’s lives, their work environment, and climate better. I am glad to be able to contribute towards a smoke-free future with PMI.
